Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the scientific approach to computer science in building and maintainging efficient software applications for end users. Software engineerning is the core of technological innovation, efficiency and security, ensuring best practices in developing user applications

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  a. Developing software - this is bringing a new technological idea into the market and building it from scratch
  b. Maintaining software - this is the continuous process of ensuring that the built application runs as intended
  c. Updationg software - this involves improving the efficiency of an already existing software

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. Planning - this defines the problem at hand and what measures are to be taken to solve the problem in software development
b. Design - this analyses the requirements, in detail stages and steps to be followed to develop the software
c. Coding - is the actual process where you write code that solves the problem
d. Testing - This is checking whether the application developed meets the intended purpose
e. Implementation - this is putting the software application into real world use
f. Maintenance - this involves updating the software to ensure it works well

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall is a rigid sequential development methodology. Once a stage is visited, it is never revisited again. Phases are distinct.
  Agile is iterative, and the phases are interlinked. It is best used where flexibility is desired


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 A software engineer captures requirements, works on software design, development, testing, releases, and maintenance.
 A Quality Assurance Engineer monitors every phase of software development
 A project manager organizes software develpment tasks and assigns tasks to software engineering teams

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They make the software development experience more accessible to the user
They improve the developer experience by providing tools in one environment and easy management of codes
Common IDEs are VS code, PyCharm, Visual Studio, Intellij, NetBeans, Codeblocks

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a. Technical challenges such as debugging and complexity
b. Communication challenges among teams
c. Project management challenges
Common solutions include good planning and better coding practices

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves checking individual modules whether they work as expected independently
Integration testing involves combining modules and testing them together
System testing involves testing the whole application as a whole, as a single entity
Acceptance testing involves checking with the targeted audience whether the application meets their needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of guiding AI to provide desired and smarter responses. It enhances AI improvement and getting more accurate responses

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: "Tel me about development"
Improved: "What is software development"
